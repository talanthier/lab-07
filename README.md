# STAT 108: Lab 7
## Logistic Regression

7th Lab for STAT 108: Linear Regression. In this lab we work with the Spotify Attributes dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/geomack/spotifyclassification).
The data can also be found in the raw data folder in this repository. The dataset includes song attributes from 2017 songs on Spotify as well as data on whether or not the user the data was collected for likes the song. In this lab, we will be building a model to predict whether a user likes a song based on some of these attributes using a logistic regression model.
