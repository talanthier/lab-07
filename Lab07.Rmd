# Lab 7: Logistic Regression

In this lab we will be investigating Spotify song attribute data from 2017 from a single user. The raw dataset can be found on the Github Repository.

```{r}
spotify <- read.csv('data/spotify.csv')
glimpse(spotify)
```


## Data Prep & Modeling

We will be creating a model to predict whether or not the user likes a song or not. Here, the response variable is `target` where 1 means the user liked the song, 0 means they did not like the song. Note that in the glimpse above, `target` is an integer value which we need to change to a factor. We also will need to change `key` to a factor.

```{r}
spotify <- spotify %>%
  mutate(target = as.factor(target))
```
